# Real-Time Vendor Product Tracking with AI

## Assignment Overview

This assignment involves creating a basic real-time vendor product tracking system using AI and machine learning. The goal is to detect and track products in a warehouse-like environment from a pre-existing or self-recorded video. You will use object detection models to identify and track items within a video feed. The project must be completed within a day.

## Objectives

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
- Use an existing video dataset or create a short video (1-2 minutes) of products in a warehouse-like environment.
- Extract key frames from the video.
- Label the products in the extracted frames to prepare them for model training.

### 2. Model Development:
- Develop a basic object detection model using a pre-trained model like YOLOv3 or SSD.
- Train the model on the labeled frames to detect and classify the products within the video.

### 3. Basic Tracking System:
- Implement a simple tracking system to track product locations over time in the video feed.
- Ensure detected products are highlighted with bounding boxes as they appear in the video.

## Deliverables

1. **Video Data**: 
   - A short video (or extracted frames) of products in a warehouse-like setup.
   - Labeled frames for training the detection model.
   
2. **Detection Model**:
   - A basic object detection model trained to detect a few products in the video.
   - Include the code used for model training and detection.

3. **Tracking Output**:
   - A video or a series of frames showing detected and tracked products with bounding boxes drawn around them.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - OpenCV (for video processing)
  - TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for model development)
- **Pre-trained Models**: YOLOv3, SSD (for faster implementation)
